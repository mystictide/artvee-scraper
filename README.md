### Scrapes artwork data from [Artvee](https://artvee.com/), either into a folder with downloaded images, or direct image links into a JSON file.

## Why?
Because Artvee does not yet offer an API and I need a collection of public domain artwork for another project.
<br />
..And because it was a decent enough reason for me to finally give Python a shot.
